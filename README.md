# Mus√©es-de-France
Scraping Tripadvisor to create a dataset of all the museums in France.



There wasn't any such list before except for one for a smaller subset of about 1200 official museums. 

The one I created contains about 3500 museums although there is missing location data for 215 museums, about 6% of the dataset.

The dataset is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oSnd34wdA47xow5K24vyQPvfpdoTZB0BS4TmFG_pEJo/edit?usp=sharing)
